# Technical plan

- [x] Create and test object construction
- [x] Set up random product selection
  - [x] Check against previous set
- [x] Track display count
- [x] Render products to DOM as HTML elements
- [x] Add on-click to track participant choices
- [x] Clarify variable names
- [x] Simplify checking against previous set - compare against an array of the last set rather than Boolean properties on the product objects
- [x] Call next round of product selection after participant choice is made
  - [x] Confirm results are being retained after maxRounds is reached
- [x] Design a report with list elements to display results
