# Technical plan

- [x] Create and test object construction
- [x] Set up random product selection
  - [x] Check against previous set
- [x] Track display count
- [x] Render products to DOM as HTML elements
- [x] Add on-click to track participant choices
- [ ] Clarify variable names
- [ ] Simplify checking against previous set - compare against an array of the last set rather than Boolean properties on the product objects
- [ ] Call next round of product selection after participant choice is made
- [ ] Design a report with list elements to display results
